# About TorghostNG
TorghostNG is a tool that make all your internet traffic anonymized through Tor network.

Rewritten from [TorGhost](https://github.com/SusmithKrishnan/torghost) with Python 3.

TorghostNG was tested on:
* Kali Linux
* Manjaro
* ...

# What's new in TorghostNG 1.2
* Fixed `update_commands` and others in [`torghostng.py`](https://github.com/gitkern3l/TorghostNG/blob/master/torghostng.py)
* Changed a few things in [`theme.py`](https://github.com/gitkern3l/TorghostNG/blob/master/torngconf/theme.py)
* Changed a few things in [`install.py`](https://github.com/gitkern3l/TorghostNG/blob/master/install.py)
* Now you can change Tor circuit with `-r`

# Before you use TorghostNG
* For the goodness of Tor network, BitTorrent traffic will be blocked by iptables. Although you can bypass it with some tweaks with your torrent client ðŸ˜¥. It's difficult to completely block all torrent traffic.
* For security reason, TorghostNG is gonna disable IPv6 to prevent IPv6 leaks (it happened to me lmao).

# Installing TorghostNG
TorghostNG currently supports:
* GNU/Linux distros that based on Arch Linux
* GNU/Linux distros that based on Debian/Ubuntu
* GNU/Linux distros that based on Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, openSUSE
* [Solus OS](https://getsol.us)
* [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org)
* Anh the elder guy: [Slackware](http://slackware.com)
* (Too much package managers for one day :v)

To install TorghostNG, open your Terminal and enter these commands    
    
    git clone https://github.com/githacktools/TorghostNG
    cd TorghostNG
    sudo python3 install.py
    sudo torghostng
    
But with Slackware, you use `sudo python3 torghostng.py` to run TorghostNG :v

# Help

      -h, --help      Show this help message and exit
      -s, --start     Start connecting to Tor
      -x, --stop      Stop connecting to Tor
      -r, --renew     Renew the current Tor circuit
      -id COUNTRY ID  Connect to Tor exit node of a specific country. Go to CountryCode.org to search country ID
      -mac INTERFACE  Randomly change MAC address. Use 'ifconfig' to show interface devices
      -c, --checkip   Check your current IPv4 address
      --dns           Use this to fix DNS when website address can't be resolved
      -l, --language  Change the display language. English is the default
      --list          Show the available languages list
      -u, --update    Check for update
      --nodelay       Disable delay time

You can combine multiple choices at the same time, such as:
* `torghostng -s -m INTERFACE`: Changing MAC address before connecting
* `torghostng -c -m INTERFACE`: Checking IP address and changing MAC address
* `torghostng -s -x`: Connecting to Tor anh then stop :v
* ...

# How to update TorghostNG
Open Terminal and type `torghostng -u` with sudo to update TorghostNG, but it will download new TorghostNG to `/root`, because you're running it as root. If you don't like that, you can type `git pull -f` and `sudo python3 install.py`.

# Notes before you use Tor
Tor can't help you completely anonymous, just almost:

* [Use Traffic Analysis to Defeat TOR](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/use-traffic-analysis-defeat-tor-0149100)
* ...

It's recommended that you should use [NoScript](https://noscript.net) before before surfing the web with Tor. NoScript shall block JavaScript/Java/Flash scripts on websites to make sure they won't reveal your real identify.

# And please
* **Don't spam or perform DoS attacks with Tor.** It's not effective, you will only make Tor get hated and waste Tor's money.
* **Don't torrent over Tor.** If you want to keep anonymous while torrenting, use a no-logs VPN please.
